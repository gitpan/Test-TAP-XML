NAME
    Test::TAP::XML - Output test results as XML

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::TAP::XML

        my $t = Test::TAP::XML->new();

        $t->run_tests(qw( t/foo.t t/bar.t );

        print $t->xml;

DESCRIPTION
    Test::TAP::XML is a subclass of Test::TAP::Model (which in turn is a
    subclass of Test::Harness::Straps). This means it is trivial to add XML
    output support to an existing test harness based on Test::Harness.

OBJECT METHODS
    All of the Test::TAP::Model methods are avaialable along with the
    following methods:

  xml

    This method will return the XML text that contains the information
    output by the tests.

        my $xml = $t->xml;

CLASS METHODS
  from_xml

    This method will create a new Test::TAP::XML object from a string (a
    scalar or a scalar ref) containing XML.

        my $tap_model = Test::TAP::XML->from_xml($xml);
